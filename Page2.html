			<h3>The Sport of Water Polo is a very difficult sport which requires the use of the entire body to play the sport. So it doesn't matter how good you run or how well you throw a ball. For if you do not know how to toss the ball and eggbeater (moving your legs to keep you above water). There is strategy to the game whether you shoot the ball or you do a drive there are many facets to the game. </h3>

			<h3>I personally play the position of center it is (personally) the hardest postition in the game. It is the most physical part of the game. Normally the strongest players play that position. You wrestle for postion to shoot the ball for you are the closest to the goal, eventhough you face away from the goal and have to shoot differently than any other postion. With all of the work you have to do, you still have to swim up and down the pool.</h3>
